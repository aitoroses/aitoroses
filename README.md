I don't write code. I specify what needs to exist, agents build it, I verify the result. That's not a prediction. I ship production software this way every day.

I've been building AI agent tooling since 2023, before Claude Code or Codex existed. Years of experimenting, learning what works, learning what breaks. That's what led to [Terrarium](https://terrarium.run): the cloud platform where agent workflows run. Everything I ship, I ship through it.
